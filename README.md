# Python 101: Python Libraries for Data Analysis - NumPy and Pandas

A comprehensive tutorial covering the fundamental concepts and operations for **NumPy** and **Pandas** - two essential Python libraries for data analysis.

## Overview

This project provides hands-on learning materials for:
- **NumPy**: Linear algebra library for multidimensional arrays and scientific computing
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis tool built on NumPy

## Features

✨ **12 Comprehensive Tasks** covering:
1. Single and multi-dimensional NumPy arrays
2. NumPy built-in methods and functions
3. Mathematical operations in NumPy
4. Array slicing and indexing
5. Conditional element selection
6. Pandas fundamentals and DataFrames
7. Reading CSV and HTML data with Pandas
8. DataFrame operations and filtering
9. Applying custom functions to DataFrames
10. Sorting and ordering data
11. Concatenating and merging DataFrames
12. Comprehensive project combining all concepts

## 🎯 Mini Challenges

Each task includes mini challenges to reinforce learning:
- Challenge #1-9: Individual concept reinforcement
- Project Challenge: Real-world scenario combining all concepts
